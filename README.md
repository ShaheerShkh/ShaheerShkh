  - [IT Infrastructure Design and Security with Windows Server 2022](https://1drv.ms/w/c/b9a1e3cee0663589/EVBEMTyeTJNMqPmqRkygbLsBxQjMy_HEBqw5PZRlPoWvuw?e=aJTWY5) 

This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and enhancement of a secure IT infrastructure for a fictitious company using Windows Server 2022. The setup included a Domain Controller with DNS, a DHCP server, a File Server with shared folders, and a WSUS server for centralized updates. Active Directory was structured using Organizational Units (OUs) and the AGDLP methodology to enforce role-based access control.

Enhancements included configuring WSUS to manage updates across the domain, automating network drive mapping with Group Policy, and enforcing security measures like password complexity and account lockout policies. A daily backup strategy was implemented for critical servers, and performance monitoring ensured stability and efficiency.

This project highlights expertise in Windows Server administration, Active Directory, GPOs, WSUS, and IT infrastructure security, showcasing a scalable and well-documented environment built with industry best practices.
